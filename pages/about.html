        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="font-body text-lg xl:text-2xl w-11/12">2018 was the year dropped his debut album. Omar was known early in his life for not being able to sing but he wanted to be able to sing so he started taking vocal lessons. He then started making music back in 2016 and slowly building up a fanbase on soundcloud. Growing up Latin-American helped influence Omar's kind of music leading to some parts of songs containing Spanish which adds a nice twist on his songs.</p>

    <div>
        <p class="font-body text-lg xl:text-2xl pt-4 sm:pt-24 w-11/12 mx-auto">2019 was a good year for Omar, he had dropped his second album and went on a tour called "The Voyager Tour". I personally attended a show in San Francisco and it was such an amazing performance. His music and style had some hints of the 80s with the pop side of his music. Although a lot of his songs were upbeat he did have some heart wrenchers that were amazing.</p>

    <div>
        <p class="font-body text-lg xl:text-2xl pt-4 sm:pt-24 w-11/12 mx-auto">In Omar's career at this point he had elevated his music tremendously. He was able to get a feature from a popular latin artist Kali Uchis. Her presence on the song "Bad Life" helped elevate Omar's career to the next level. This song was featured on his Apolonio album which has a great list of upbeat and fun songs.

        <p class="font-heading text-white text-3xl pb-5">2021</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="font-body text-lg xl:text-2xl w-11/12">2021 wasn't very eventful music wise for Omar, he had only dropped a couple Spotify exclusive singles. He did go on one of his biggest tours yet which was his "Desvelado Tour". I was fortunate enough to attend 3 of these shows and they were some of the most memorable and fun shows I have been to. He had another great artist with him, she goes by Deb Never and she added a nice touch of rock to the tour to switch things up.</p>

        <p class="font-heading text-white text-3xl pb-5">2022</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="font-body text-lg xl:text-2xl w-11/12">This was the year Omar's name became known all around. 2022 Omar had dropped his big project called "Ivory". This album was filled with so much talent and amazing songs. His most popular one "Evergreen" helped take his career off into another level. This song blew up on Tik Tok and more people started to follow his music. He had gone on another tour called "The Prototype Tour". This one had many sold out shows and brought in many new fans. Definitely a year to remember for Omar.</p>

    <div>
        <p class="font-body text-lg xl:text-2xl pt-4 sm:pt-24 w-11/12 mx-auto">2023 was another great year for Omar. Performed at festivals and got to tour in other countries. Due to him always busy on the road he wasn't able to drop as much music as he did the previous year but he did not let us down and dropped his "Live for Me" EP. This EP had many beautifully put together songs that will get you thinking about life but so much to enjoy. Omar was also nominated for the first time for a Grammy this year which is a huge accomplishment.</p>
