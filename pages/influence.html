    <h1 class="font-heading">OMAR'S INFLUENCE</h1>
    <p class="font-body">Omar Apollo has a huge influence on my life in the way his music opened up my eyes to different genres of music and helped me learn to keep an open mind about almost anything. I used to listen to a lot of music that was popular on the radio and played a lot of the artists that most people would listen to on an everyday basis. During my junior year I started to branch out of my music in the slightest and that is when I came across Omar Apollo. I had heard "Erase" for the first time and I loved the song. I started listening to his music more and more and soon became obsessed with the music and the different vibe he had to offer. Omar had open up the door for me to discover many great artist that make different types of music and even some people with not a big following. Now I listen to all sorts of music and I discover more and more everyday. Omar Apollo is influential to many now and I am glad I can say I found him early because he helped me open up my mind to new ideas and artists. Below are some of the artists/groups I had discovered from listening to Omar. </p>
