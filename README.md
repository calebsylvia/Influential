NavBar - I really like how you made your navbar it really sticks out from a traditional navbar used. I would recommend using a target = "_blank" for the linktree so it will open a new tab.
Home Page - I love the layout of your home page it looks really neat and simple
About Page - I like how you layed out your images and text
Music Page - The recommend song was a cool add-on

Mobile Home Page - Looks good Would add some spacing between the text and image
Mobile About Page - Looks Great!
Mobile Music Page - Cards look a little stretched. Unless you wanted them to be like that
Mobile Influence Page - The pictures doesn't look center. It's off the left a little.

Other than that amazing website, I really like the design and components you used.
